['vpn'] 			 			 = {['name'] = 'vpn', 			  				['label'] = 'VPN Device', 				['weight'] = 700, 		['type'] = 'item', 		['image'] = 'vpndevice.png', 		['unique'] = false, 	['useable'] = false, 	['shouldClose'] = true,    ['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = 'Keeps people out of your business'},
```
